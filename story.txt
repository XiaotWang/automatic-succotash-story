In the deep woods, there was a longly sweetcorn robot named Kiki.
He looks like every sweetcorn, except he has a body that is made of iron.
Nobody likes him because of the cranking sound he makes.

One day he met a real sweetcorn Swift who lost his hearing. Because Kiki looked like a sweetcorn, Swift thought Kiki is a real sweetcorn as sweet as himself. They quickly became friends. 

Swift and Kiki then made a suicide blood pact that if one corn goes down the other does aswell. One day after hitting up the west side of town Swift got taken down by some sweet potatoes in a
hit and run. Kiki remembering the suicide pact tried to slice his wrists open but quickly realized that he could not cut through his metal appendages.

Connor's addition: And then Kiki found a ray of sunshine in his life, as a man came by selling oil that would ease his painful squeaking. He was saved!
