In the deep woods, there was a longly sweetcorn robot named Kiki.
He looks like every sweetcorn, except he has a body that is made of iron.
Nobody likes him because of the cranking sound he makes.

One day he met a real sweetcorn Swift who lost his hearing. Because Kiki looked like a sweetcorn, Swift thought Kiki is a real sweetcorn as sweet as himself. They quickly became friends.
